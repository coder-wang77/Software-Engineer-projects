        To help you build a visually appealing and professional-looking website, 
        I've curated a set of colors, fonts, text styles, and buttons that you can explore and customize.
        These design elements are carefully chosen to enhance readability, create visual hierarchy,
        and give your site a modern, polished look. Whether you're designing for a business, blog, or portfolio, 
        feel free to use these combinations as inspiration or directly implement them into your own website for a 
        cohesive and engaging user experience.
